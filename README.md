CODAM/42 project = ft_containers

In this project you will implement the various container types of the C++ standard tem- plate library.
For each container, turn in the appropriately named class files. The namespace will always be ft and
your containers will be tested using ft::. You need to respect the structure of the reference container.
If itâ€™s missing a part of the Coplien form, do not implement it. As a reminder, we are coding in C++98,
so any new feature of the containers MUST NOT be implemented, but every old feature (even deprecated)
is expected.
